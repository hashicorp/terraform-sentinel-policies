# [get_ancestor_module_source](../tfconfig-functions.sentinel#L583)
This function finds the source of the first ancestor module that is not a local module of the module containing an item from its `module_address` using the [tfconfig/v2](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/sentinel/import/tfconfig-v2.html) import. (A local module is indicated by use of a source starting with "./" or "../".)

It does this by parsing `module_address` which will look like "module.A.module.B" if the item is not in the root module or "" if it is in the root module. It then finds the `module_call` in the parent module that calls the original module and then gets `source` from that module call.

However, if the `source` starts with "./" or "../", the function then calls itself recursively against the address of the module's parent module. It keeps doing this until it finds a non-local module and then gives that module's source.

## Sentinel Module
This function is contained in the [tfconfig-functions.sentinel](../../tfconfig-functions.sentinel) module.

## Declaration
`func get_ancestor_module_source(module_address)`

## Arguments
* **module_address**: the address of the module containing some item, given as a string. The root module is represented by "". A module with label `network` called by the root module is represented by "module.network". if that module contained a module with label `subnets`, it would be represented by "module.network.module.subnets".

## Common Functions Used
None.

## What It Returns
This function returns a string containing the source of the ancestor module represented by the `module_address` parameter. If called against the root module of a Terraform configuration, it returns "root".

## What It Prints
This function does not print anything.

## Examples
Here is an example of calling this function, assuming that the tfconfig-functions.sentinel file that contains it has been imported with the alias `config`:
```
module_address = r.module_address
module_source = config.get_ancestor_module_source(module_address)
```

It is used by the [restrict-resources-by-module-source.sentinel](../../../cloud-agnostic/restrict-resources-by-module-source.sentinel) policy.
