# [resources_by_type](../tfconfig-functions.sentinel#L20)
This function finds all managed resources of a specific type in the Terraform configuration of the current plan's workspace using the [tfconfig/v2](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/sentinel/import/tfconfig-v2.html) import.

## Declaration
`func resources_by_type(type)`

## Arguments

## Common Functions Used
None

## What It Returns
This function returns a single flat map of resources indexed by the complete [addresses](https://www.terraform.io/docs/internals/resource-addressing.html) of the resources (excluding indices representing their counts).

## What It Prints
This function does not print anything.

## Examples
Here are some examples of calling this function, assuming that the tfconfig-functions.sentinel file that contains it has been imported with the alias `config`:
```
allEC2Instances = config.resources_by_type("aws_instance")

allAzureVMs = config.resources_by_type("azurerm_virtual_machine")

allGCEInstances = config.resources_by_type("google_compute_instance")

allVMs = config.resources_by_type("vsphere_virtual_machine")
```
