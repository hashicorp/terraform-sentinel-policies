# This policy uses the tfconfig/v2 import to require providers to have
# version constraint, this is a good practise.

# Import common-functions/tfconfig-functions/tfconfig-functions.sentinel
# with alias "config"
import "tfconfig-functions" as config

# Get all providers
allProviders = config.all_providers()

#Get all providers tht has version_constraint as undefined or empty.
#think it as : (mc.version_constrain else "") is ""
violatingProviders = filter allProviders as address, mc {
    mc.version_constraint else "" is ""
}

# Print any violations
for violatingProviders as address, mc {
    print("Provider", address, "does not have version_constraint set")
}

# Main rule
main = rule {
  length(violatingProviders) is 0
}
