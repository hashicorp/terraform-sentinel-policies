# the region of the AWS provider since that requires the
# tfconfig/v2 import.

import "tfplan-functions" as plan

# Allowed EC2 Zones
# Include "null" to allow missing or computed values

# Get all EC2 instances
allEC2Instances = plan.resources("aws_instance")

# Filter to EC2 instances with violations
# Warnings will be printed for all violations since the last parameter is true
